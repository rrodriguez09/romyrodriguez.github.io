								I am presently an Astronomy PhD student at The Ohio State University (OSU). I work with Professor <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~gaudi/">Scott Gaudi</a> on the detection and characterization of transiting exoplanets. My research goals include constraining the composition of small, terrestrial exoplanets by combining precise radii, masses, and host star chemical abundances. Using data from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope <a href="https://keltsurvey.org/">(KELT)</a> survey and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), I led the discovery of two ultra short-period hot Jupiters, KELT-25b and KELT-26b.  
								Previously, I worked with Professor <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~lopez.513/Home.html">Laura Lopez</a> studying the variability and flare rates of M-dwarf stars using data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml">(ASAS-SN)</a>. During that time, in collaboration with the ASAS-SN team, I led the discovery of a <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-04-powerful-flare-m-dwarf-star.html">powerful flare</a> on a previously undiscovered M dwarf.

								I obtained my bachelors and master's degree in Physics at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras. For my master's thesis, I worked under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.drballard.space/">Sarah Ballard</a> on the characterization of M-dwarf exoplanet hosts using near-infrared spectroscopy. I enjoy science outreach and mentoring, and I am mentoring physics and astronomy undergraduates at OSU through the <a href="https://physics.osu.edu/Polaris#:~:text=Mission%20Statement,Departments%20of%20Physics%20and%20Astronomy.">Polaris</a> program and the <a href="https://u.osu.edu/astrosociety/2020/08/21/space-science-mentorship-program/"> Space Science Mentorship Program with the Ohio State School for the Blind</a>.

								<b>Hot Jupiters Around Hot Stars</b><br>I broadly study exoplanets, which are planets orbiting stars other than the sun, to try to understand their individual properties, structure, and composition. Last year, I worked with Professor Scott Gaudi and the KELT collaboration on two ‘hot Jupiters’ (Jupiter-sized planets in short-period orbits), discovered by KELT and observed by TESS. KELT-25b and KELT-26b are both very close to their A-type parent stars, resulting in extremely high equilibrium temperatures and inflated atmospheres. These objects represent good opportunities for follow-up atmospheric characterization.

								<b>M-dwarf Flares</b><br>M dwarf stars are the coolest (temperature-wise) and the most common type of star, comprising about 75% of all stars in the Milky Way. These stars are very magnetically active compared to other stars, and they show star spots, coronal mass ejections, and stellar flares that are detectable across all wavelengths.
								Flares are powerful bursts of energy that result from magnetic lines reconnecting in the surface of stars. These events not only complicate the search for exoplanets around M dwarfs, but also have important implications for the emergence and evolution of life on such planets. Studies have shown that persistent 
								and energetic flares can have adverse effects on the atmospheres of planets around M dwarfs. Under the guidance of Professor Laura Lopez, we studied ~90% of the known M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere with the ASAS-SN survey, finding that the later-type M dwarfs are generally more active than the earlier (hotter) stars.

								<b>M-dwarf Planet Hosts from K2</b><br> As a student at the University of Puerto Rico, under the mentorship of Professor Sarah Ballard, I characterized a sample of M dwarfs with confirmed exoplanets from the K2 mission. We determined the physical properties of these stars by employing an empirical relationship between the equivalent width of certain spectral features in the near-infrared and properties their radii, temperatures and luminosities. Using the derived properties of their host stars, we derived radii and equilibrium temperatures of the planet candidates orbiting them.
